Version 1 of Odin Project website thrown together in roughly 1 hour.
Not pretty by any means, but after "bootcamping" my way through FreeCodeCamp's HTML + CSS this is what I've accomplish on my first ever website design.
Will hopefully update this and correct this to mimic Google.com better in the future.
